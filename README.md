# PathfindingFromMatrix

A program that takes in a designated number of vertices in a graph, the matrix representing said graph, a source node, and a target node. 

The program will then use a pathfinding algorithm to traverse the graph from the source node to the target node.

The program will also paint the graph, with edges and their weights, along with the shortest path highlighted from the source to the target node.
